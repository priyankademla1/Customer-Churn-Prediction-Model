# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Model

It's a binary classification problem where the task is to predict whether a customer will churn i.e. likelihood of customer to leave the service

Process: We will define, train and evaluate different predictive models suitable for classification problems and test them on the test set

Metric: The metric used is accuracy and F1_score to evaluate the performance of the different models and to finally select the best suited model for this dataset
